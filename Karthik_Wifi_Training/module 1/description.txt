1. In Which Layer in the OSI Model Is the Wi-Fi Standard/Protocol?

Wi-Fi works mainly in two layers of the OSI model: the Physical Layer (Layer 1) and the Data Link Layer (Layer 2).

Wi-Fi operates on two layers of the OSI model:

Layer 1 (Physical Layer): Deals with transmission of raw data over radio waves that encompass many factors including frequency, modulation, and power levels.

Layer 2 (Data Link Layer): Involves MAC addressing and frame control, which include data framing, error detection, and access control (CSMA/CA).



2. Wi-Fi Device Used in Daily Life and Their Wireless Features

Several Wi-Fi devices and their wireless specifications are listed below:

- 802.11n  --->  Wi-Fi 4  
- 802.11ac --->  Wi-Fi 5  
- 802.11ax --->  Wi-Fi 6  



3. What Are BSS and ESS?

- The BSS (Basic Service Set):  
    - A group of wireless devices connected to a single Access Point (AP).  
    - Identified by BSSID (the MAC address of the AP).  
    - Used in infrastructure mode. 

- The ESS (Extended Service Set):  
    - More than one BSS connected through distribution means like Ethernet.  
    - Identified by ESSID (Wi-Fi network name).  
    - Used for large networks like enterprise Wifi.



4. Basic Functionality of a Wi-Fi Access Point

- Signal Broadcasting:		Broadcasts radio signals enabling devices to connect wirelessly.  
- MAC Filtering: 		Filters MAC addresses of devices to allow or deny connection.  
- Channel Selection: 		Chooses the best frequency channel to minimize interference.  
- Encrypted Data Transmission: 	Encrypts transmitted data using WPA/WPA2/WPA3.  
- Traffic Management: 		Manages data traffic to optimize network performance.  
- Supports DHCP: 		Dynamically assigns IP addresses.  
- QoS (Quality of Service): 	Provides priority to certain types of network traffic.  



5. Bridge Mode vs Repeater Mode: 

Bridge Mode :
	The purpose is to bridge (connect) two networks together. Bridge mode gets a different IP address. No speed loss. More like connecting different LANs across distance. Used in situations where it is like connecting different LANs across distance.

Repeater Mode :
	The purpose is to extend the range of the existing Wi-Fi coverage. Repeater mode retains the same IP as the main router. Speed is reduced due to signal repetition. Used in situations like expanding the Wifi that covers a particular area in households.



6. Characteristics 802.11a and 802.11b differed.

    		802.11a 							802.11b

Frequency: 	5 GHz				 				2.4 GHz 
Speed: 		up to 54 Mbps 							up to 11 Mbps 
Range: 		Shorter distance coverage of approximately 35m indoors 		Approx. 100 m indoors 
interference 	Less interference  						High Interference for Business environment Home Wi-Fi Connections. 



7. Comparison of 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi Bands:


Feature 	2.4 GHz 							5 GHz 

Speed 		Lower (up to 600 Mbps)						Higher (up to 9.6 Gbps) 
Range 		Longer (greater wall penetration)				Shorter (less wall penetration) 
Interference 	More prone to interference 					Less interference 
Latency 	Slightly higher 						Lower 
Channels 	11 (overlapping) 						23 (non-overlapping) 

2.4GHz is Best for Long range, low bandwidth activities High speed activities whereas 5GHz is best for short range 



8. Difference Between IEEE and WFA 

IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)

	It is a global organization building standards. It has built a Wi-Fi standard (like the 802.11 family). It provides technical specification. It is the blueprint for how Wi-Fi operates in real world.

WFA (Wi-Fi Alliance)

	A non-profit organization that certifies Wi-fi devices by ensuring that the devices meet the respective standards for operability and inter-operability. Moreover WFA manages the Wi-Fi which indicates that the device had been tested for reliability and connectivity.



9. Types of Wi-Fi Internet Connectivity Backhaul 

	Wi-Fi backhaul refers to how the network connects to the internet or other parts of the network. 

Wired Ethernet backhaul: The most common and reliable, using Ethernet cables to connect APs to the internet.
 
Wireless Mesh backhaul:  APs connect wirelessly to each other, extending coverage without needing wires. 

Fiber-optic backhaul:    Uses high-speed fiber-optic cables to provide extremely fast internet, typically used in commercial or large-scale networks. 

In my home setup, I use fiber-optic backhaul connected to a Wi-Fi 6 router, which provides fast, stable internet across the house, supporting both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.

Very high capacity and used by ISPs for backhaul of large networks. 

DSL (Digital Subscriber Line):

This medium has a fairly moderate speed and latency, which is why it is usually used for home internet. The wire-bound connections of these satellites utilize satellites. It also has higher latencies. 

Cellular (4G/5G) Backhaul:	Mobile data connectivity. Mobile hotspots are used. 

My College Backhaul: 

Name of Backhaul:	Mepco Schlenk Engineering College Network
Type: 			Wired Mesh
Speed:			up to 100 Gbps
Latency: 		<100ms
Frequency:		2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.



10. Wi-Fi Topologies and Their Applications 


Infrastructure Mode:		It is the connectivity through Access Points (AP). Clients will be connected to the home/office networks. 

Ad-Hoc Mode: 			Direct peer-to-peer connection. Used in small, temporary networks. 

Mesh Topology: 			Multiple nodes communicate directly. It is used in larger areas (smart cities, campuses). 

Point to Point(PtP): 		Connects two locations directly. Used in long-distance connections. 

Point to Multipoint (PtMP): 	One device connects to multiple devices. Used in Wi-Fi extenders and hotspots.

All have backward compatibility.

Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac): Introduced faster speeds over the 5 GHz band but lacked advanced features like OFDMA and uplink MU-MIMO.

Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax): Enhanced performance with higher speeds, lower latency, and better efficiency in crowded environments through technologies like OFDMA and TWT.

Wi-Fi 6E: Extended Wi-Fi 6 capabilities into the 6 GHz band, offering additional spectrum for improved performance.

Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be): Represents a significant leap with theoretical speeds up to 46 Gbps, ultra-wide 320 MHz channels, 4096-QAM modulation, and advanced features like Multi-Link Operation (MLO) and enhanced MU-MIMO, making it ideal for high-demand applications like AR/VR and 16K streaming.​


2. Role of OFDMA in Wi-Fi 6

OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access):

Divides a channel into multiple subcarriers called Resource Units.

Allows multiple devices to transmit/receive simultaneously on different RUs.

Benefits:

	Efficient bandwidth use
	Reduced latency
	Better performance in high-density areas (offices, stadiums) like some big setups.


3. Benefits of Target Wake Time (TWT) in Wi-Fi 6

TWT allows devices to schedule communication times with the access point.

Devices can "sleep" longer and wake only when needed.

Ideal for IoT:

	Lower power consumption
	Longer battery life
	Less congestion in the airwaves


4. Significance of 6 GHz in Wi-Fi 6E

Adds a new, clean band (5.925–7.125 GHz)

More spectrum results up to 14 additional 80 MHz channels or 7 extra 160 MHz channels

No legacy devices results in less interference

Enables high throughput and low latency


5. WiFi-6 Vs WiFi-6E

Feature		Wi-Fi 6			Wi-Fi 6E

Bands		2.4 & 5 GHz		2.4, 5 & 6 GHz
Interference	Higher (crowded bands)	Lower (clean 6 GHz)
Range		Better at 2.4 GHz	Slightly lower at 6 GHz
Channels	Limited			More non-overlapping
Device Support	Backward compatible	Needs Wi-Fi 6E devices


6. Major Innovations in Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be)

320 MHz channel width

4096-QAM (higher data rate)

Multi-Link Operation (MLO)

Preamble puncturing (improves spectrum usage)

Enhanced MU-MIMO (16 streams)

Improved latency and throughput for gaming, VR, etc.


7. Multi-Link Operation (MLO) in Wi-Fi 7

Allows simultaneous transmission across multiple bands/channels (e.g., like 5 & 6 GHz)

Enhances:

	Throughput (more data paths)
	Redundancy (failover if one link degrades)
	Latency (parallel data paths = faster delivery)


8. Purpose of 802.11k and 802.11v (Roaming Enhancements)

Standard	Purpose				Role in Roaming

802.11k		Neighbor Reports		AP helps device find nearby APs
802.11v		BSS Transition Management	AP suggests best AP to roam to

Together, they enable the client to make smarter roaming decisions rather than selecting randomly.


9. Fast BSS Transition (802.11r)

Speeds up the authentication process when roaming between APs

Uses fast handshake via pre-authentication

Crucial for VoIP, video calls, gaming and VR where we can’t afford delay


10. 802.11k/v/r Working Together in Enterprise Roaming

802.11k: Client learns about neighbors (AP list)

802.11v: AP suggests the best candidate

802.11r: Fast transition to the selected AP

Together, they provide:

	Seamless roaming
	No dropped calls or buffering
	Better user experience in large WLANs (universities, hospitals, enterprise)

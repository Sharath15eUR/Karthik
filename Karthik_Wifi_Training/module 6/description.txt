1. What are the pillars of Wi-Fi security?

The three main pillars of Wi-Fi security are:

	Authentication: Verifies the identity of devices trying to connect.

	Encryption: Protects data transmitted over the air from being read by unauthorized users.

	Integrity: Ensures that the data hasnâ€™t been tampered with during transmission.


2. Difference between Authentication and Encryption in Wi-Fi security

		Authentication				Encryption

Purpose		Verifies the identity of users/devices	Protects data from eavesdropping

Occurs during	Before data transmission		During data transmission

Example 	WPA2-PSK, WPA2-Enterprise (802.1X)	AES (WPA2/WPA3), TKIP (WPA)


3. Differences between WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3

Feature		WEP		WPA		WPA2		WPA3

Introduced	1997		2003		2004		2018

Encryption	RC4		TKIP + RC4	AES (CCMP)	AES (GCMP-256)

Security	Weak		Better than WEP	Strong		Very Strong

Authentication	Shared Key	PSK/802.1X	PSK/802.1X	SAE (Simult auth of eql)

Status		Deprecated	Deprecated	Widely used	Emerging standard


4. Why is WEP considered insecure compared to WPA2 or WPA3?

	Weak encryption (RC4) with predictable IV (Initialization Vectors)

	Short key lengths (40 or 104 bits)

	Vulnerable to key recovery attacks (e.g., aircrack-ng)

	Cannot prevent replay attacks

	Thus, WEP can be cracked in minutes using modern tools.


5. Why was WPA2 introduced?

WPA2 was introduced to:

	Replace WPA (which used the weak TKIP protocol)

	Provide strong encryption using AES-CCMP

	Ensure compliance with IEEE 802.11i security standards

	Address known vulnerabilities in WPA


6. What is the role of the Pairwise Master Key (PMK) in the 4-way handshake?

	The PMK is derived from the passphrase (in WPA2-PSK) or from the RADIUS server (in WPA2-Enterprise).

	It is used to generate the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) during the 4-way handshake.

	The PTK secures unicast traffic between the client and access point.


7. How does the 4-way handshake ensure mutual authentication between the client and the access point?

	Both client and AP prove they know the PMK without sending it.

	Each sends a nonce (random number), and both derive the same PTK.

	If the Message Integrity Code (MIC) is valid, it confirms that both share the same PMK, achieving mutual authentication.


8. What will happen if we put a wrong passphrase during a 4-way handshake?

	The client and AP will derive different PMKs and PTKs.

	MIC verification will fail.

	The handshake will not complete, and the client cannot connect to the Wi-Fi network.


9. What problem does 802.1X solve in a network?

	802.1X solves the problem of unauthorized access by:

		Providing port-based network access control

		Requiring user/device authentication before allowing network access

		Preventing rogue users from connecting to wired or wireless networks


10. How does 802.1X enhance security over wireless networks?

	Uses RADIUS servers for centralized authentication

	Supports EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) methods like EAP-TLS

	Separates authentication from encryption, allowing secure dynamic key generation

	Mitigates attacks like credential theft and spoofing in enterprise environments

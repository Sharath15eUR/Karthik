1. SplitMAC Architecture and Its Performance Benefits

	SplitMAC architecture separates the control plane and data plane between the Access Point (AP) and the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC).

- AP handles:  

  - RF management (signal transmission, reception).  
  - Local frame encryption/decryption.
  - Client association and authentication requests. 

- WLC handles:  

  - Centralized management (roaming, QoS, security policies).  
  - Advanced packet processing and forwarding decisions. 

Performance Benefits:

	Reduces AP processing load → APs focus on RF transmission.  
	Improves scalability → Multiple APs are managed centrally.  
	Enhances security → Policies are enforced at the controller.  
	Simplifies network management → Centralized control from WLC.



2. CAPWAP and AP-Controller Flow

	CAPWAP (Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points)** is a tunneling protocol used to manage APs from a WLC.  

	Flow Between AP and Controller:

	1. Discovery Phase:  
  		- AP searches for the WLC using DHCP, DNS, or broadcast.  
	2. DTLS Connection Setup:
   		- Secure CAPWAP tunnels are established for control and data traffic.  
	3. Configuration and Firmware Download:  
   		- AP downloads configurations from WLC.  
	4. AP Joins WLC: 
   		- WLC assigns VLANs, SSIDs, and policies to AP.  
	5. Client Management Begins:  
   		- AP starts serving clients based on WLC policies.  



3. CAPWAP in OSI Model & Tunnels

	CAPWAP fits in the OSI Model:

		- Control Messages: Layer 3 (Network Layer) ---> Uses UDP 5246  
		- Data Traffic: Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)   ---> Uses UDP 5247

	Two CAPWAP Tunnels & Their Purpose:
	
	1. Control Tunnel (UDP 5246)

   		- Securely exchanges AP-WLC configurations, policies, and management data.  
   		- Encrypted via DTLS.  

	2. Data Tunnel (UDP 5247)

   		- Transports client data packets between AP and WLC.  
   		- Can be encrypted for security.  



4. Difference Between Lightweight APs and Cloud-based APs

	Feature		Lightweight APs			Cloud-based APs                      

 	Control Type	Managed by WLC                  Managed by Cloud Controllers         
 	Scalability     Limited by WLC capacity         Highly scalable                          
 	Management      Requires on-premises WLC        Managed via cloud dashboard          
 	Redundancy      Depends on WLC availability     Higher redundancy, cloud-based control   
 	Use Case        Enterprise networks             Remote offices, small businesses     



5. How the CAPWAP Tunnel Is Maintained Between AP and WLC

- Keepalive Messages:  
  - AP and WLC exchange periodic heartbeat packets to maintain connectivity.  

- DTLS Encryption:
  - Ensures security in the control tunnel.  

- Reassociation Mechanism: 
  - If AP loses connection, it automatically re-establishes the CAPWAP tunnel. 
 
- Failover Mechanism:
  - If WLC goes down, AP can connect to a secondary WLC (if it is configured).  



6. Sniffer Mode vs. Monitor Mode

	Mode		Sniffer Mode					Monitor Mode

Purpose     	Captures and forwards raw packets for analysis		Detects rogue APs, interference, and signal strength
How It Works 	AP acts like a packet analyzer (like Wireshark)		AP scans all channels for RF analysis 
Use Case 	Network troubleshooting, security audits		RF management, IDS/IPS detection



7. Best AP Mode for Local Network When WLC is in WAN

	Best AP Mode: FlexConnect Mode (HREAP Mode)

	- Allows APs to switch traffic locally instead of sending everything to WLC.
  
	- How It Works:

  		- Client authentication is local (AP handles it).  
  		- Data traffic is switched locally, reducing WAN bandwidth usage.  
  		- If WLC goes down, AP still provides local connectivity.  



8. Challenges of Deploying 50+ Autonomous APs in a University

- Channel Interference:  

  - Without central control, APs may use overlapping channels, causing interference.  

- Roaming Issues: 
  - No seamless handoff between APs.
  
- Manual Configuration Burden:  
  - Each AP requires separate SSID, security, and QoS configuration.
  
- Security Risks:  
  - No centralized authentication or policy enforcement.  

- Limited Scalability:  
  - Difficult to manage large-scale Wi-Fi deployments.  

Solution: Use Lightweight APs with WLC instead of standalone APs.



9. What Happens If WLC Goes Down in Lightweight AP Local Mode?

- Clients Remain Connected

  - AP continues serving existing connected clients.
  
- New Clients Cannot Join  

  - No new client associations.
  
- No Centralized Management

  - QoS, VLAN tagging, and security policies stop working.
  
- Local Traffic Continues

  - If VLANs are local, traffic between clients may still work.  

To avoid downtime:  

- Deploy Redundant WLCs or use FlexConnect Mode for local authentication.

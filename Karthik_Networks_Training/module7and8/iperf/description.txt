IPERF3 

sudo apt install iperf3 - to install iperf on your Linux machine.

Ensure Devices Are on the Same Network

Make sure both your server (running on your Ubuntu machine) and client (laptop or phone) are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

Run the iperf3 Server

On your server (Ubuntu):iperf3 -s -p 5202

Run Various Tests from the Client

Commands:

TCP Test:		iperf3 -c <server_ip> -p 5202 				{TEST #1}
UDP Test:		iperf3 -c <server_ip> -p 5202 -u 			{TEST #2}
Bidirectional Test:	iperf3 -c <server_ip> -p 5202 -d 			{TEST #3}
Reverse Test:		iperf3 -c <server_ip> -p 5202 -R 			{TEST #4}
Multicast Test:		iperf3 -c 224.0.0.1 -p 5202 -u -T 32			{TEST #5}
			(network should support multicast)			

Parallel Streams Test:	iperf3 -c <server_ip> -p 5202 -P 10			{TEST #6}

Bandwidth:		The amount of data transferred per second.
Transfer:		The total amount of data transferred.
Retransmits:		For TCP tests, how many packets were retransmitted.
Jitter:			Variation in packet delay (for UDP tests).
Packet Loss:		The percentage of packets lost (for UDP tests).

I have tested for localhost as of now 127.0.0.1. Similarly I can test for client machines in my network.

Test #1 (TCP Test)

Transfer: 14.0 GB
Bitrate: 11.9 Gbits/sec

Observation:
	The speed is very high initially (up to 38 Gbits/sec) but fluctuates significantly, dropping to as low as 483 Mbits/sec before stabilizing around 11.9 Gbits/sec on average.

	This could indicate buffer saturation or congestion.

Test #2 (UDP Test)

Transfer: 1.25 MB
Bitrate: 1.04 Mbits/sec
Jitter: 4.614 ms
Packet loss: 0/40 (0%)\

Observation:
	This is a low-bandwidth UDP test, but no packets were lost, indicating good reliability.

	The jitter values are low, meaning consistent packet delivery with minimal delay variation.

Test #3 (UDP Test)

Transfer: 1.28 MB
Bitrate: 1.07 Mbits/sec
Jitter: 2.998 ms
Packet loss: 0/41 (0%)

Observation:
	Similar to Test #2 with low jitter and no packet loss.

	Consistent low-bandwidth UDP performance.

Test #4 (TCP Test)

Transfer: 9.56 GB
Bitrate: 8.21 Gbits/sec

Observation:
	Stable TCP throughput with minimal fluctuation.

	Consistent multi-Gigabit performance throughout the test.

Test #5 (TCP Test)

Transfer: 11.6 GB
Bitrate: 9.92 Gbits/sec
Retransmissions: 20
Observation:
	High throughput but with a few retransmissions.

	The congestion window (Cwnd) remains stable at 5.25 MB, indicating the connection is stable.
	
	Retransmissions may slightly affect performance.

Test #6 (Multiple parallel TCP streams)

Multiple connections:
	Bitrates range from 1.09 Gbits/sec to 2.67 Gbits/sec for individual streams.

Observation:
	Youâ€™re using parallel streams to fully utilize the bandwidth.

	The combined throughput seems to be scaling effectively, suggesting no major bottlenecks.

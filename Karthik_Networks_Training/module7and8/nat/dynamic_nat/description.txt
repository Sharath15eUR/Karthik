Dynamic NAT (Network Address Translation)

Dynamic NAT Configuration on ISP and NAT Router:

- Network Setup:

  - A Switch connects local PCs to a NAT Router.
  - The NAT Router connects to an ISP Router, which has a WAN connection.

- Router Configuration:

  - The NAT Router has two interfaces:

    - FastEthernet0/0: Connected to the LAN (192.168.1.0/24).
    - FastEthernet1/0: Connected to the ISP (203.0.113.0/24).

  - Dynamic NAT is configured using:

    - IP NAT pool ("MYPOOL") with a range of public IPs (203.0.113.100-203.0.113.110).
    - Access list (ACL) permitting internal network translation.
    - NAT rules associating the ACL with the public IP pool.

- Verification Commands:

  - show ip nat translations: Displays the current NAT mappings.
  - show ip nat statistics: Checks NAT configuration status.


Dynamic NAT Testing (Ping Results):

- Ping from PC0 and PC1:

  - PC0:

    - Successfully pings 192.168.1.1 (local gateway).
    - Pings 203.0.113.2 (ISP Router) with partial success (50% loss).
    - Successfully pings 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS).

  - PC1:

    - Pings 8.8.8.8, but one packet is lost, possibly due to network congestion or NAT translation delay.

  - Dynamic NAT is successfully working, as internal addresses (192.168.1.x) are translated to public IPs from the NAT pool.

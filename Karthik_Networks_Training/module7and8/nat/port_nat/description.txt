PAT (Port Address Translation) 

PAT Configuration on ISP and NAT Router:

- Network Setup:

  - A Switch connects local PCs (PC0 and PC1) to a NAT Router.
  - The NAT Router connects to an ISP Router, which has a WAN connection.

- Router Configuration:

  - The NAT Router has two interfaces:

    - FastEthernet0/0: Connected to the LAN (192.168.1.0/24).
    - FastEthernet1/0: Connected to the ISP (203.0.113.0/24).

  - PAT is configured using:

    - Access Control List (ACL) to permit internal network translation.
    - Overloaded NAT rule to translate multiple private IPs into a single public IP with different port numbers.
    - Default route for forwarding traffic to the ISP.

- Verification Commands:

  - show ip nat translations: Displays active PAT translations.
  - show ip nat statistics: Checks PAT configuration status.

PAT Testing (Ping Results):

- Ping from PC0 and PC1:

  - PC0:
    - Successfully pings 192.168.1.1 (local gateway).
    - Pings 203.0.113.2 (ISP Router) with partial success (50% loss).
    - Successfully pings 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS).

  - PC1:
    - Successfully pings 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS).

  - PAT is successfully working, as multiple internal private IPs (192.168.1.x) are translated into a single public IP (203.0.113.100) using different port numbers.

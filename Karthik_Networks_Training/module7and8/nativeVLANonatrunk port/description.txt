Network Setup and Device Information for VLAN and Trunk Port Configuration

Devices Used: 

- 1 Router   
- 2 Switches   
- 4 PCs (PC0, PC1, PC2, PC3)  

VLAN Configuration: 

- VLAN 10 (DATA)  
- VLAN 20 (VOICE)  

Connections:

- Router0 is connected to both switches via trunk ports.  
- Switch0 and Switch1 are connected to each other using a trunk link.  
- PCs are connected to different VLANs on Switch0 and Switch1.  

VLAN and Trunk Port Configuration:
 
- VLAN 10 (DATA) and 20 (VOICE) are created on both switches.  
- Trunk ports are configured to allow VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 traffic.
  
- Switch0 and Switch1 both have "show vlan brief" and "show interfaces trunk" commands executed, confirming: 
 
  - VLANs exist and are active.  
  - Trunk ports are correctly configured using **802.1q encapsulation**.  
  - The VLANs allowed on trunk include **10 and 20**.  


Verification of Network Connectivity and Issues Observed:
  
Ping Test Results from PC0:

- Ping to 192.168.20.2 → Successful (with minor packet loss, 25)  
- Ping to 192.168.20.3 → Failed (100% packet loss) 


- VLANs are set up correctly and trunking is active.  
- Router has inter-VLAN routing enabled.  
- Ping from PC0 to a VLAN 20 device partially works but fails to another device, suggesting VLAN 20 communication issues.

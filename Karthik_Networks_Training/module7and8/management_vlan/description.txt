Management VLAN Configuration and Remote Access Verification

1. Network Setup and Device Information:

- Devices Used:

  - 1 Router   
  - 1 Switch   
  - 1 PC 

- Connections:  

  - Router5 is connected to Switch0.  
  - PC0 is connected to Switch0.  

2. VLAN and IP Configuration:

- The switch has VLAN 99 configured as the "management VLAN".  
- An IP address 192.168.1.100 is assigned to VLAN 99 for remote access.  
- The "show vlan brief" command confirms VLAN 99 exists but is not assigned to any active ports.  

3. Remote Access Testing (Telnet Login):

- PC0 attempted to ping 192.168.1.100, but all requests timed out, indicating ICMP might be blocked or the VLAN configuration needs verification.  
- A Telnet connection to 192.168.1.100 was successful.  
- After initiating the Telnet session, the switch prompted for a password, confirming that remote access is enabled.  
- The user successfully logged in and gained access to the switch command-line interface.  

- The management VLAN IP is reachable via Telnet but not through ICMP (ping), possibly due to security settings.  
- The switch's VTY lines are configured to allow Telnet access.  
- The network setup allows remote management of the switch from PC0.

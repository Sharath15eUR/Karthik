Network Setup and Device Information for a BASIC ACL set up:

- Devices Used:
  - 1 Router 
  - 1 Switch

  - 1 Server

- Connections:
  - Router0 is connected to Switch0.
  - PC0, PC1, and Server0 are connected to Switch0.

Access Control List (ACL) Configuration:

- The router is configured with an Extended ACL (Number: 100) to control traffic.

- ACL Rules:

  1. Deny TCP traffic from 192.168.1.20 to any destination on port 80 (HTTP).
  2. Deny TCP traffic from 192.168.1.20 to any destination on port 443 (HTTPS).

  - The ACL is assigned to the FastEthernet 0/0 interface.

Verification of ACL & Network Connectivity:

- ACL Verification Commands Used:

  - show access-lists
  - show running-config | include access-list

- The router correctly displays the ACL configuration.

Ping and Telnet Tests:

- Ping Test from PC0 to 192.168.1.100 (Server0):

  - Ping was successful, indicating ICMP traffic is allowed.
  
- Telnet Test to Server on Port 80 (HTTP):

  - Attempted connections from PC0 and PC1 to 192.168.1.100 on port 80.
  - Connection opens but is closed by the remote host, suggesting that the server or ACL settings affect HTTP traffic.

- ICMP (ping) is allowed.
- TCP traffic on port 80 and 443 is blocked for 192.168.1.20.

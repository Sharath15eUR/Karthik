ARP Spoofing is a hacking technique where an attacker tricks a device into believing they are another trusted device by sending fake ARP messages. This allows them to intercept, modify, or block network traffic.

attacker pc gets in itself as a man-in-the-middle to perform attack.

Setup the Network
-----------------

PC0		192.168.1.2/24  000C.29AA.BB01
PC1		192.168.1.3/24  000C.29AA.BB02
attacker pc	192.168.1.10/24 000C.29AA.BB03
router(gateway)	192.168.1.1/24


Connect two victim PCs, one attacker PC, a router (gateway), and a switch using Ethernet cables.
Assign IP addresses manually to each device.

Check Normal ARP Communication
------------------------------

Use the arp -a command on a victim PC to view its ARP table.

Send a ping to another PC to confirm normal network communication.

Device		IP Address	MAC Address	ARP Table Entry (Gateway)
Router(Gateway)	192.168.1.1	(Real MAC)	192.168.1.2 → 000C.29AA.BB01
PC0		192.168.1.2	000C.29AA.BB01	192.168.1.1 → (Router's MAC)
PC1		192.168.1.3	000C.29AA.BB02	192.168.1.1 → (Router's MAC)
Attacker PC	192.168.1.10	000C.29AA.BB03	normal state


Perform ARP Spoofing
--------------------

On the attacker PC, modify the ARP cache of victim PCs:

Trick PC1 into believing the attacker is the router.
Trick PC2 into believing the attacker is PC1.

This makes all traffic between the victims go through the attacker.

Verify the Attack
-----------------

Use the arp -a command again on the victims to check if their ARP entries have changed.
Use Wireshark to capture ARP packets and confirm fake ARP replies.


Device		IP Address	MAC Address	ARP Table Entry (Gateway)
Router(Gateway)	192.168.1.1	(Real MAC)	192.168.1.2 → 000C.29AA.BB03 (Attacker)
PC0		192.168.1.2	000C.29AA.BB01	192.168.1.1 → 000C.29AA.BB03 (Attacker)
PC1		192.168.1.3	000C.29AA.BB02	192.168.1.1 → 000C.29AA.BB03 (Attacker)
Attacker PC	192.168.1.10	000C.29AA.BB03	Now controls traffic(spoof)

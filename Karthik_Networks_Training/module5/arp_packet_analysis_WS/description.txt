Role of IP and MAC Address:

Sender’s MAC & IP (in Request): identifies who is making the request.
Target’s IP (in Request): unknown IP for which the MAC is requested.
Sender’s MAC & IP (in Reply): identifies the owner of the requested IP.
Target’s MAC & IP (in Reply): addressed to the requester, updating the ARP cache.

Just it is enough to select the appropriate interface in wireshark and apply "arp" filter.
Then start capturing the packets. Furthermore stop the capturing and then analyze the captured packets.

Here as if,

my laptop is being connected to a wireless WiFi connection,

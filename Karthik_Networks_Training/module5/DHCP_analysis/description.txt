DHCP DORA Process Captured in Wireshark
========================================

DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

The DORA process is used by a device (client) to get an IP address from a DHCP Server.

 Message		Source IP → Destination IP	Function

DHCP Discover			0.0.0.0 → 255.255.255.255			Client asks for an IP
DHCP Offer		DHCP Server → Client         	Server offers an IP
DHCP Request   			Client → DHCP Server         		Client requests the offered IP
DHCP Acknowledge 		DHCP Server → Client    			Server confirms & assigns IP


Explanation of Wireshark Capture:

Step 1: DHCP Discover

- Frame 155 → Source MAC: f8:54:f6:91:c1:7f (Client)
- The client device (your PC) broadcasts a request (0.0.0.0 → 255.255.255.255) to find a DHCP server.

Step 2: DHCP Offer

- Frame 168 → Source IP: 192.168.43.1 (DHCP Server)
- The DHCP server responds with an IP Offer (e.g., 192.168.43.152).

Step 3: DHCP Request

- Frame 170 & 180 → Source IP: 192.168.43.152 (Client)
- The client requests the same offered IP (192.168.43.152) from the server.

Step 4: DHCP Acknowledge

- Frame 225 → Source IP: 192.168.43.1 (DHCP Server)
- The server confirms the assignment, and the client can now use the IP.

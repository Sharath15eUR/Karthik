This explains the setting up a PT-Empty Router in Cisco Packet Tracer with 4 FastEthernet interfaces, subnetting a 192.168.1.0/24 network into 4 subnets, assigning IP addresses, and verifying connectivity.

Devices Needed 

1 Router (PT-Empty)
4 Switches
4 PCs

Power Off the Router and Add Interfaces.
Drag & Drop Four FastEthernet Modules (PT-HWIC-2FFE).
Turn On the Router.

enter privileged mode and global configuration mode in the router CLI to configure the interfaces based on the following,

We are dividing 10.0.0.0/24 into 4 subnets:



Original Network: 10.0.0.0/24 
- Total IP addresses: 256 (0 to 255)  
- Usable addresses: 256 - 2 (network & broadcast) = 254

Dividing into 4 subnets:
- 256 / 4 = 64 addresses per subnet  
- Each subnet will have 64 addresses (including the network(first one) and broadcast addresses(last one)).

New Subnet Mask:
- To get 4 subnets, we need to borrow 2 bits from the host portion (/24 + 2 = /26).  
- /26 in decimal is 255.255.255.192

Calculate the New Subnets:

	Each /26 subnet has:

		Subnet increment: 256 - 192 = 64
		Total IPs per subnet: 2^(32-26) = 64
		Usable hosts: 64 - 2 = 62 (excluding network & broadcast addresses)

Subnet Breakdown:

1. Subnet 1:
   - Network Address:	10.0.0.0/26
   - Broadcast Address: 10.0.0.63 
   - Usable IP Range: 	10.0.0.1 - 10.0.0.62

2. Subnet 2:
   - Network Address:	10.0.0.64/26  
   - Broadcast Address:	10.0.0.127  
   - Usable IP Range:	10.0.0.65 to 10.0.0.126

3. Subnet 3:  
   - Network Address:	10.0.0.128/26  
   - Broadcast Address:	10.0.0.191  
   - Usable IP Range:	10.0.0.129 to 10.0.0.190

4. Subnet 4:  
   - Network Address:	10.0.0.192/26  
   - Broadcast Address:	10.0.0.255  
   - Usable IP Range:	10.0.0.193 to 10.0.0.254


Subnet	Network	Address	SubnetMask		Usable IP Range			Router Interface IP

 1  	10.0.0.0     	255.255.255.192 	10.0.0.1 - 10.0.0.62  		10.0.0.1  
 2  	10.0.0.64    	255.255.255.192 	10.0.0.65 - 10.0.0.126 		10.0.0.65  
 3  	10.0.0.128   	255.255.255.192 	10.0.0.129 - 10.0.0.190 	10.0.0.129 
 4  	110.0.0.192   	255.255.255.192 	10.0.0.193 - 10.0.0.254 	10.0.0.193 

Assigning IPs to Router Interfaces

example :

for subnet 1

interface FastEthernet6/0
ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.192
no shutdown
exit

further do similarly for other subnets.


save the configuration and verify the interface info and status.

3	10.0.0.200	255.255.255.192		10.0.0.193


Verify Connectivity

Check Connectivity using PING
1. Go to PC0 → Open Command Prompt → Run:

 	ping 10.0.0.70  # Test PC1 to PC2
	ping 10.0.0.140 # Test PC1 to PC3
	ping 10.0.0.200 # Test PC1 to PC4

  
   yo people here, 
   ping is successful, network is working!

2. Check Routing Table on Router CLI:

   show ip route
   
   seen 4 directly connected networks.

Role of IP and MAC Address:

Sender’s MAC & IP (in Request): identifies who is making the request.
Target’s IP (in Request): unknown IP for which the MAC is requested.
Sender’s MAC & IP (in Reply): identifies the owner of the requested IP.
Target’s MAC & IP (in Reply): addressed to the requester, updating the ARP cache.

Just it is enough to select the appropriate interface in wireshark and apply "arp" filter.
Then start capturing the packets. Furthermore stop the capturing and then analyze the captured packets.

The release and renew commands are used to manage Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) leases. These commands help devices obtain or refresh their IP addresses from a DHCP server.

1. ipconfig /release :

	Disconnects the device from the network by releasing its assigned IP address back to the DHCP server.
	Clears the existing DHCP lease and removes IP settings.
	
	Use Cases:

	When troubleshooting IP conflicts.
	If switching between different networks.
	Before assigning a static IP to a device.

2. ipconfig /renew :

	Requests a new IP address from the DHCP server.
	If the DHCP lease is still valid, it may reassign the same IP.
	
	Use Cases:

	When the network connection is lost or unstable.
	To get a new IP address from the DHCP server.
	After using the release command.


Thereby a new traffic is being generated from intial stage to analyse the arp packets in detail.

Here as if,

my laptop is being connected to a wireless WiFi connection,

1. ARP Request (Example: Frame 13484)

Info Column: "Who has 192.168.1.26? Tell 192.168.1.1"

Sender (Source MAC & IP):

MAC Address: a8:74:84:cd:ba:fa (Sender's MAC)
IP Address: 192.168.1.1 (Sender's IP)
Role: This device is sending an ARP request to find out the MAC address associated with IP 192.168.1.26.

Target (Destination MAC & IP):

MAC Address: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff (Broadcast)
IP Address: 192.168.1.26 (Target IP)
Role: The target device (192.168.1.26) is expected to reply with its MAC address.


2. ARP Reply (Example: "192.168.1.26 is at f8:54:f6:91:c1:7f")

Sender (Source MAC & IP):

MAC Address: f8:54:f6:91:c1:7f (Responder's MAC)
IP Address: 192.168.1.26 (Responder's IP)
Role: This device is responding to the ARP request by providing its MAC address.

Target (Destination MAC & IP):

MAC Address: a8:74:84:cd:ba:fa (Requester’s MAC)
IP Address: 192.168.1.1 (Requester’s IP)
Role: This reply is sent directly to the device that originally asked for the MAC address of 192.168.1.26.



Importance of ARP in Packet Forwarding

-MAC Address Resolution

	ARP is crucial for mapping an IP address to a MAC address.
	Without ARP, devices wouldn’t know where to send packets in a local network.

-Packet Forwarding within a Subnet

	When sending data to another device in the same subnet, the sender uses ARP to find the recipient’s MAC address.

-Gateway Communication

	If the destination is outside the subnet, ARP is used to find the MAC address of the default gateway (router).

-Efficient Network Communication

	ARP replies are cached to reduce redundant requests and improve performance.

-Security Considerations

	ARP Spoofing attacks can manipulate ARP tables, leading to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
	Using Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) can help mitigate ARP-related attacks.

NAT Configuration in Cisco Packet Tracer with 2 PCs, a Router, a Switch, and a Cloud

This network demonstrates how to use Network Address Translation (NAT) on a Cisco Router
to allow private IP addresses (192.168.1.x) from two PCs to access the internet. The topology
includes a single router connected to a switch (for the LAN) and a cloud (representing the ISP
or external network). The image shows the physical arrangement of devices and the router’s CLI
where NAT and IP addressing are configured.

Devices & Connections:

1. PC0 and PC1
   - Each PC is assigned a private IP address in the 192.168.1.0/24 network.
   - Both PCs connect to the switch using Copper Straight-Through cables.

2. Switch (Switch0)
   - Connects the PCs to the router’s LAN interface.
   - Operates at Layer 2 to forward frames between the PCs and the router.

3. Router (Router0)
   - Has two interfaces:
     - LAN Interface (e.g., FastEthernet0/0) connected to Switch0, configured with an IP in 192.168.1.0/24.
       This interface is marked as "ip nat inside."
     - WAN Interface (e.g., FastEthernet0/1) connected to the Cloud, configured with a public or
       IP address (e.g., 200.200.200.x). This interface is marked as "ip nat outside."

   - NAT Overload (PAT) is configured so both PCs can share the router’s public IP when accessing the internet.

4. Cloud
   - Represents the external network in Packet Tracer.
   - The router’s WAN interface is connected here to simulate internet connectivity.

Key IP Addressing:

- PC0:
  - IP Address: 192.168.1.2
  - Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
  - Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1

- PC1:
  - IP Address: 192.168.1.3
  - Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
  - Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1

- Router LAN (Inside):
  - Interface FastEthernet0/0
  - IP Address: 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
  - ip nat inside

- Router WAN (Outside):
  - Interface FastEthernet0/1
  - IP Address: 200.200.200.2 255.255.255.0
  - ip nat outside
  - Default route to the ISP/cloud (e.g., 200.200.200.1)

NAT Configuration (Router CLI):

Below is a simplified version of the commands used on the router to enable NAT Overload:

  enable
  configure terminal

  ! Configure LAN interface
  interface FastEthernet0/0
   ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
   ip nat inside
   no shutdown
  exit

  ! Configure WAN interface
  interface FastEthernet0/1
   ip address 200.200.200.2 255.255.255.0
   ip nat outside
   no shutdown
  exit

  ! Create an access list permitting the local network
  access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255

  ! NAT Overload using the WAN interface
  ip nat inside source list 1 interface FastEthernet0/1 overload

  ! Default route to the ISP
  ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 200.200.200.1

  end
  write memory

Verified with ping to external IP and nat table of the router with valid entries being stored.

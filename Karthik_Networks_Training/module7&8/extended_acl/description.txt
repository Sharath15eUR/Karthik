Network Setup and Device Information for a EXTENDED ACL set up

- Devices Used:
  - 1 Router 
  - 1 Switch 
  - 2 PCs (PC0[192.168.1.10], PC1[192.168.1.20]) PC1 is blocked based on the ACL
  - 1 Server 

- Connections:
  - Router0 is connected to Switch0.
  - PC0, PC1, and Server0 are connected to Switch0.

Extended Access Control List (ACL) Configuration:

- The router is configured with multiple Extended ACLs (100, 101) to control traffic.

- ACL Rules:

  - ACL 100:

    1. Deny TCP traffic from host 192.168.1.20 to any destination on port 80 (HTTP).
    2. Deny TCP traffic from host 192.168.1.20 to any destination on port 443 (HTTPS).
    3. Permit all other traffic.

  - ACL 101:

    1. Deny TCP traffic from host 192.168.1.10 to host 192.168.2.100 on port 80 (HTTP).
    2. Deny TCP traffic from host 192.168.1.10 to host 192.168.2.100 on port 21 (FTP).
    3. Permit all other traffic.

- ACL Applied On:

  - ACL 100 is assigned to an interface for filtering specific traffic.
  - ACL 101 is applied to control communication between PC0 and Server0.

Verification of ACL & Network Connectivity:

- ACL Verification Commands Used:

  - show access-lists
  - show running-config | include access-list

- The router correctly displays the ACL configuration with match counts for each rule.

Ping and Telnet Tests:

- Ping Test from PC1 to 192.168.2.100 (Server0):

  - Ping failed with "Destination host unreachable," indicating traffic is blocked.
  
- Telnet and FTP Tests:

  - Attempts from PC0 and PC1 to 192.168.2.100 on ports 80 and 21.
  - Connection attempts timed out, confirming that ACL 101 blocks traffic as intended.

- ICMP (ping) is blocked for 192.168.2.100.
- TCP traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and port 21 (FTP) is blocked between 192.168.1.10 and 192.168.2.100.
- Other traffic is permitted as expected.

VoIP and Data VLAN Configuration

-VLAN 10 (Data VLAN) is assigned to PC1, ensuring that regular data traffic remains isolated from voice traffic.
-VLAN 20 (Voice VLAN) is configured for the VoIP phone (Home VoIP2), prioritizing voice packets for better call quality.
-The switch port connecting the VoIP phone is configured as a multi-VLAN access port. 

-It allows:
	Data traffic (VLAN 10) from the PC connected through the phoneâ€™s PC port.
	Voice traffic (VLAN 20) from the VoIP phone itself.

By configuring the switch port to support both VLANs, the VoIP phone can send tagged voice traffic (802.1Q), while data traffic remains untagged, ensuring proper communication without interference.

In this setup, VLANs are configured to segment network traffic efficiently. 

- VLAN 10 (Data VLAN): Assigned to PC1, ensuring that standard network traffic is isolated.  
- VLAN 20 (Voice VLAN): Dedicated to the VoIP phone (Home VoIP2) for prioritizing voice traffic. 
 
- The switch port connected to the VoIP phone is set up to allow both:  

  - Untagged data traffic (VLAN 10)** from the PC connected through the phone.  
  - Tagged voice traffic (VLAN 20)** for proper Quality of Service (QoS).  

This configuration ensures that VoIP calls receive priority while keeping data traffic isolated, preventing congestion and improving performance.

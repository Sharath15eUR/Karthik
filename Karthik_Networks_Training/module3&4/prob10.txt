 Viewing MAC Address Table of a Linux-based Switch

The MAC address table keeps track of all devices connected in a bridged Linux network switch. Active bridges can be listed using brctl show (or bridge link in modern systems) and the MAC table can be accessed through bridge fdb show which would display the learned MAC addresses and their interfaces. The next command, ip link show, is used for checking the network interfaces and the MAC addresses, which allow one to identify active connecting devices. Simple ping 192.168.1.2 would be used to test Ethernet communication between the two devices. After some traffic, you check the MAC table by doing bridge fdb show and see whether the switch has learned the MAC address of the device so as to ensure correct forwarding. Such commands play a crucial role in understanding the Linux Ethernet switch and troubleshooting SDN connectivity.

Linux is based on switches that bridge the MAC address tables. These would keep track of devices connected to the network. Active bridges may be viewed using brctl show (or bridge link in modern systems); the MAC table can be viewed with bridge fdb show. This displays learned MAC addresses and their interfaces. The next command - ip link show - is used for checking the network interfaces and the MAC addresses, which allow one to identify the active connecting devices. To test Ethernet communication, a simple ping 192.168.1.2 would be sent between the two devices. After some traffic generation, one can check the MAC table again with bridge fdb show to verify whether the switch has learned the MAC address of the device, thus ensuring correct forwarding. Such commands would be very important for understanding the Linux Ethernet switch and, more importantly, troubleshooting connectivity in SDN environments.

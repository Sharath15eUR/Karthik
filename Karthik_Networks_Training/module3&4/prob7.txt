In Cisco Packet Tracer, the 'tracert' command can be used to find out at what point packets are dropped when 'ping' is not able to connect. A network will be created by setting up a router with a switch between two PCs. Connect them with **Copper Straight-Through** cables. Configure each PC with a static IP address (for example, '192.168.1.10/24' and '192.168.2.10/2') as well as a configuration of the interfaces on the router that matches the subnet for the same. Open Command Prompt on 'PC-0' and type to run 'tracert 192.168.2.10' to trace its route. If packets are suspended at the router, either check for missing routes ('show ip route') or configure static route ('ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1'). If hops show '* * *', the problem may be a firewall stopping ICMP packets. Checking interface status ('no shutdown') and gateway configuration can help to restore communication.

Configuring a Basic LAN Interface Using ip Command

In Linux, a fundamental LAN interface will be configured with the ip command used for the management of the network interfaces. First, available interfaces can be listed by issuing the command ip link show, which displays all interfaces and their statistics (up/down) along with MAC addresses. To set up static IP configuration, use sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0: 192.168.1.100 is the IP address; /24 is the subnet mask (255.255.255.0); and eth0 is the interface. Set the interface in the 'up' state with the command sudo ip link set eth0 up so that it can send and receive traffic. Finally, with sudo ip route add default via 192.168.1.1, the default gateway is set such that the packets are routed properly. Lastly, the configuration is verified by ip addr show eth0 and ip route show.

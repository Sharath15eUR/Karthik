Report on Linux Kernel's Handling of Ethernet Devices and Network Interfaces

Robust support for Ethernet communication has indeed been provided from the Linux kernel perspective because, through its complete network stack, which involves networks interfacing with device drivers, data can both be sent and received with ease over wired networks as the interface manages network devices efficiently.

Linux kernel and ethernet communication
Ethernet devices are abstracted away by the Linux kernel into network interfaces e.g. eth0, ens33, etc. Such interfaces are managed by netdev subsystem and are visible under /sys/class/net/. Kernel modules (drivers) interface with the physical Network Interface Cards (NICs) to allow communications.

In processing packets, the socket API will send application data to the TCP/IP stack, which will encapsulate it and pass it to the NIC driver for transmission. On receiving, an interrupt is generated by the NIC and kernel processes the ethernet frame, routing its payload to the respective protocol handler or user application.

The Linux kernel can load the appropriate Ethernet device driver, such as e1000 for Intel NICs or r8169 for Realtek NICs, depending on the hardware. These drivers are required to process everything from packet transmissions and receptions to network interface operation. A user could search for NIC settings and driver details through ethtool and sysfs.

Traffic control on the Linux kernel entails managing access into and out of the host such that a packet or a group of packets is forwarded correctly. Packets are directed into the network by use of routing tables (ip route) while the security and filtering of packets are done against firewall rules (iptables or nftables).

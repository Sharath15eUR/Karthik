Exploring Wireshark, TCPDump, and Cisco Packet Tracer for Packet Filtering

Packet filtering is most crucial in analyzing network traffic by capturing and filtering the required traffic. This document covers three popular tools, namely Wireshark, TCPDump, and Cisco Packet Tracer.

1. Wireshark—GUI-Based Packet Capture & Filtering

Wireshark is a graphical network protocol analyzer that captures network traffic and provides inspection facilities.

Installation: 
sudo apt update && sudo apt install wireshark -y


Steps to capture Packets using Wireshark

Open Wireshark.
Choose a network interface (i.e. eth0, wlan0).
Click on Start Capture.
Wireshark Filters

Filter by protocol: ip, ipv6, tcp, udp, icmp.
Filter by IP: ip.src == 192.168.1.100, ip.dst == 192.168.1.1, ip.addr == 8.8.8.8.
Filter by port: tcp.port == 80, udp.port == 53, tcp.port == 22.

2. TCPDump—Command-Line Packet Capture Tool

TCPDump is a tool for command-line packet capture and filtering of other network traffic.

Installation

sudo apt install tcpdump -y

Capture Packets with TCPDump

To capture all packets:

sudo tcpdump -i eth0

To write packets to a file:

sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap

Filters For TCPDump

Capture HTTP traffic: tcpdump -i eth0 port 80
Capture packets to/from an IP: tcpdump -i eth0 host 192.168.1.100
Capture ping packets: tcpdump -i eth0 icmp
Capture packets for HTTPS: tcpdump -i eth0 'tcp and dst port 443'
